Copy the default.json in this directory to ~/.lulli/.

When running under Windows (via WSL), ~ is c:\Users\<USER>\.lulli\ instead.
See `deployment/run-docker-image.sh` for gory details.

TODO:
  - "baseUrl": "https://some.host/path/to/images"
    ^ maybe this can be made optional, and we let express serve the images
  - "rootPath": "/usr/src/lulli/data"
    ^ remove this from config, Docker image forces this path, no need for configurability here
  - "frontendPath": "../frontend"
    ^ probably also not neccessary at all
